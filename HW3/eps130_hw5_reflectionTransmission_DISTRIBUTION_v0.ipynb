    "# Wave Interactions - Reflection & Transmission Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "It is often reasonable to assume seismic waves propagate through the Earth as plane waves, with wavefronts of constant thickness -- in other words we have think of the seismic energy traveling as a ray. This simplification allows us to apply Snell's Law and the Law of Reflection to describe the path that seismic energy takes through the the crust.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ray parameter, $p$, is a form of Snell's Law:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p = \\frac{Sin(i_2)}{\\beta_2} = \\frac{Sin(i_1)}{\\beta_1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will investigate how seismic waves move through interfaces. We will describe the refraction and reflection using transmission and reflection coefficients, respectively, which depend on geologic properties of the layer (e.g., seismic wave speed, density), angle of incidence.\n",

    "# Exercise 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "You are planning a seismic experiment with the geometry shown in Figure 1. The aim is to characterize the lateral extent of the layer interface. You have 16 short-period seismometers for this experiment. The planned source depth is 1 km (h=1km). You will arange the seismometers in a straight line beginning from x=0 (above the source) out to some maximum offset. Your boss tells you to use a station spacing of 250 m. In designing the experiment, you want to record both the direct wave (red) and the multiple wave (blue) shown below. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Answer\n",
    "Hint: This question hinges on how much the up-going ray will refract at the interface. Let the angle of incidence be $i_2$ (because it is in the bottom layer 2), and the angle of transmission into layer 1 (top) be $i_1$. Consider using the function scipy.optimize.fsolve to search over a range of angles of incidence given the conditions on h and x."
